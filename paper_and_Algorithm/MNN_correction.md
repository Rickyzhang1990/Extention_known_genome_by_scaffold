# **Paper name**  
Batch effects in single-cell RNA -sequencing data are corrected by matching mutual nearest neighbors
# **Website**  

# **Funcition**  
we propose a new method for removal of discrepancies between biologically related batches according to the presence of MNNs between batches, which are considered to define the most similar
cells of the same type across batches.

# **Knowledge**   
The first step of our method involves global scaling of the data through a cosine normalization  Y = Y/||Y||
